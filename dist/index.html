<h1> History of electronic music</h1>
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    
   <p> Electronic music emerged in the early 20th century, when inventors and composers began experimenting with devices capable of generating artificial sounds. <br>
     Pioneering instruments such as the Theremin (1919) and the Ondes Martenot showed for the first time the possibility of creating music without traditional acoustic sources. <br>

In the 1950s and 1960s, studios in France and Germany developed techniques such as musique concrète and electronic synthesis, using magnetic tape and oscillators to manipulate sounds. Composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen pushed this exploration forward. <br>

During the 1970s, the appearance of analog synthesizers—especially Moog models—brought electronic music into the popular sphere. Bands like Kraftwerk introduced a robotic and minimalist sound that influenced virtually every later genre. <br>

In the 1980s, with digital synthesizers and the MIDI standard, electronic music became more accessible. Styles such as synth-pop, house in Chicago, and techno in Detroit emerged, shaping club music. <br>

From the 1990s onward, the global expansion of rave culture gave rise to subgenres such as trance, drum and bass, ambient, hardcore, and many others. Electronic music became established as a diverse and creative ecosystem. <br>

In the 21st century, with music software, personal computers, and later digital controllers, production became completely democratized. The EDM scene brought electronic music to massive festivals, while independent producers explored more experimental styles. <br>

Today, electronic music is one of the pillars of contemporary music, influencing everything from pop to cinema and sound experimentation. </p>

    <li> Drum and Bass (D&B) – Fast rhythms and intense bass lines. </li> <br>
      <li>Electro – Sound influenced by synthesizers and drum machines.</li> <br>
      <li>Ambient – Atmospheric, relaxing, and experimental music. </li> <br> 
     <li>Tech House – Fusion of techno and house, with deeper grooves.</li> <br>
     <li>Hardstyle – Fast and hard beats, typical of electronic music festivals. </li> <br>
    <li> Future Bass – Modern sounds, emotional melodies, and impactful drops. </li> <br>
